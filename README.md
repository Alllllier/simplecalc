# Greetings!
This homework is designed to force you to exercise your knowledge of the Swift programming language. This homework does not involve iOS in any way.

Your task is simple: Make the code compile, and make all the unit tests pass. You may not change the
tests that already exist in the files in the "src/test" subdirectories; you will also be asked to add
a few tests, as well.

## To do that...
... you must first obtain a copy of the source. Do that by cloning this repository:

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/TedNeward/uw-ios-simplecalc simplecalc

This will create a local copy of the project. However, in order to *store* your changes to your own
GitHub account, you need to create a new repository on GitHub (call it simplecalc again), and then
change the project's settings to point to that new repository as the remote origin.

    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/[your-ID]/simplecalc.git

This will work regardless of whether you got the syntax of the URL correct or not, so do a quick
push to make sure it all worked correctly:

    git push

Git will ask you for your username and password, then (if everything was done correctly), it will
upload the code to the new repository, and this is your new "home" for this project going forward.
Verify the files are there by viewing your GitHub project through the browser.

***NOTE:*** Your grade for this assignment (and all future assignments) will be based on what we
see in the GitHub repository, and nothing else. If it isn't in GitHub, it doesn't exist.
